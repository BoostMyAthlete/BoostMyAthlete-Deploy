          We'd like to give you a warm welcome to BoostMyAthlete. Creating a new
          account is quick and easy. Simply select whether you want to sign up
          as a Sponsor or Athlete, and enter all the requested details
          accurately. We recommend that you take your time to ensure that your
          profile is complete and up-to-date. This will help you get the most
          out of our platform. As a Sponsor, you will be able to browse through
          the list of Athletes, and as an Athlete, you will be able to showcase
          your profile and connect with potential Sponsors.

          Once you have signed up as an Athlete, you will have direct access to
          the List of Companies where you can browse through the profiles of
          different companies that may be interested in sponsoring you. From
          location to funding budgets and sponsorship goals, all the information
          you need to make informed decisions will be listed there. On the other
          hand, if you are signed up as a Sponsor, you will be able to browse
          through the Athlete's list. Here, you will find detailed information
          about each Athlete, including their bio, location, and awards. Our
          platform makes it easy for you to find the right Athlete to sponsor
          based on your specific needs and interests.
